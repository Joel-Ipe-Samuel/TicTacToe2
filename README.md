# (Tic Tac Toe)<sup>2</sup>
A game developed in Python and Tkinter inspired by Vsauce, where the regular game of TicTacToe is scaled to have a main board and 9 sub boards. 

### Features 
The first move on the sub board can be made anywhere with it's position dictating the sub board of the next move. This version of Tic Tac Toe adds more strategy compared to the 4 turn draws that we often have in the original. The game is coded in Python's Tkinter.
